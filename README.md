# A2P - Automated Application Process
**Author:** Marc-Antoine AugÃ©

A2P is a a complete online solution to automate the administration of the Application Process of Social Hackers Academy ([see][sha-website]), based on the technologies teached in the Coding School.

The project is splitted into three parts:
  - `applicant-frontend`: a website in [React][react] which provides to the applicants a mobile-first website where it's easy to apply and check their progression ;
  - `superviser-frontend`: a website in [VueJS][vuejs] which provides to the supervisors an easy way to validate the different steps, start new cohorts... ;
  - `backend`: a complete API in [NodeJS][nodejs] and [Express][express] in order to link together the [MongoDB][mongodb] database and the frontends ;

# Release v1.0.0

- Adding words counter (on all long text questions) (resolves #24);
- Updating all static texts + email templates according to the current need ;
- Adding label, deadline and location edition on open processes (resolves #34) ; 
- Feedback on acceptation and rejection : it's possible to edit the email template directly for each applicant (resolves #35).
> The templates are written in `html` and use `Mustache` as template engine. 
- Add applicant filters by 'accepted', 'rejected', and 'pending task' (resolves #36)
- Export of applicants data in an excel file (resolves #28)

# Release v0.2.0
  - Email supports (templates could be found in `backend/emails/`). It uses [email-templates][email-templates] and [pugjs][pugjs] as the template engine. [pughtml.com][pughtml] can be used to test the template engine. An email is sent after each step
  > Deprecated in v1.0.0. All the templates are written in `html`
  - Static updates on the applicant frontend: texts are more explicit and can be edited through the file `applicant-frontend/src/static.json`.
  - HTML support on page's caption
  - Reset passwort feature (very basic, a new password is generated by the backend and sent to the user)
  - Bugs fixing on the applicant frontend: when you pressed on an 'arrow' in a text field, the page changed
  - An applicant is automatically logged in after his application
  - Delete Applicant feature (accessible through the applicant panel in the superviser website)


# Release v0.1.0  

  - Allow an applicant to apply and to an opened process
  - Allow an applicant to start completing a step and save it before submit it
  - Allow an applicant to see the status of each of his step:
  -- *todo* if not submitted,
  -- *pending* if submitted and waiting a validation by a superviser,
  -- *validated* if validated by a superviser,
  -- *rejected* if the answer should be edited and submitted again.
    Only steps in status *todo* and *rejected* can be edited.
  - Process deadline displayed
  - Checking the required answers before going next page
  - Allow swiping on mobile to change the current page
  - Allow fully customization of processes with an easy-to-use draft form (a form cannot be edited once it's opened)
  - Allow to see the progress of every applicant and validate & note every step if needed
  - Allow to start a new process from an existing one


## Installation (production)

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Marc-AntoineA/A2P.git
```

Prerequisites
- Create a MongoDB database and an user (see [Atlas][atlas])
- Create a OAuth2 token to the GMail address used (see [How to get a gmail token][nodemailer-setup]) (not useful now)
- Edit the `settings.json` file of backend properly.

On your computer, to build the code and upload everything on your hosting via ftp
```sh
./deploy.sh -ftp ftpPath -u ftpUser
```

## Installation (for development)

A2P requires [Node.js][nodejs], [React][react] and [VueJS][vuejs]

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Marc-AntoineA/A2P.git
```

#### Prerequisites
- Create a MongoDB database and an user (see [Atlas][atlas])
- Create a OAuth2 token to the GMail address used (see [How to get a gmail token][nodemailer-setup])
- Edit the `settings.json` files properly.

#### Backend
Install the dependencies and and start the server.

```sh
$ cd backend
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
The website will be accessible in `localhost:3000`.

#### Superviser-Frontend
Install the dependencies and start the server
```sh
$ cd superviser-frontend
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
The server is started on port `8080`

In production:
```sh
$ npm run build
```
build the complete application in a `/dist` folder, automatically served by the backend in the relative path: `/administration` (static files in path `/administration/static-superviser`).

### Applicant-Frontend

Install the dependencies and start the server
```sh
$ cd applicant-frontend
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
The server is started on port `3300`.

In production:
```sh
$ npm run build
```
build the complete application in a `/build` folder, automatically served by the backend in the relative path: `/` (static-files in path `/static-applicant`).
