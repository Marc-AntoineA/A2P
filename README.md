# A2P - Automated Application Process
**Author:** Marc-Antoine Aug√©

A2P is a a complete online solution to automate the administration of the Application Process of Social Hackers Academy ([see][sha-website]), based on the technologies teached in the School.

The project is splitted into three parts:
  - `applicant-frontend`: a website in [React][react] which provides to the applicants a mobile-first website where it's easy to apply and check their progression ;
  - `superviser-frontend`: a website in [VueJS][vuejs] which provides to the supervisers an easy way to validate the different steps, start new cohorts... ;
  - `backend`: a complete API in [NodeJS][nodejs] and [Express][express] in order to link together the [MongoDB][mongodb] database and the frontends ;

# Release V1!  

  - Allow an applicant to apply and to an opened process
  - Allow an applicant to start completing a step and save it before submit it
  - Allow an applicant to see the status of each of his step:
  -- *todo* if not submitted,
  -- *pending* if submitted and waiting a validation by a superviser,
  -- *validated* if validated by a superviser,
  -- *rejected* if the answer should be edited and submitted again.
    Only steps in status *todo* and *rejected* can be edited.
  - Process deadline displayed
  - Checking the required answers before going next page
  - Allow swiping on mobile to change the current page
  - Allow fully customization of processes with an easy-to-use draft form (a form cannot be edited once it's opened)
  - Allow to see the progress of every applicant and validate & note every step if needed
  - Allow to start a new process from an existing one

## Installation

A2P requires [Node.js][nodejs], [React][react] and [VueJS][vuejs]

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Marc-AntoineA/A2P.git
```

#### Prerequisites
- Create a MongoDB database and an user (see [Atlas][atlas])
- Create a OAuth2 token to the GMail address used (see [How to get a gmail token][nodemailer-setup])
- Edit the `settings.json` files properly.

#### Backend
Install the dependencies and and start the server.

```sh
$ cd backend
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
The website will be accessible in `localhost:3000`.

#### Superviser-Frontend

```sh
$ cd superviser-frontend
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
In production:
```sh
$ npm run build
```
build the complete application in a `/dist` folder, automatically served by the backend in the relative path: `/administration` (static files in path `/administration/static-superviser`).

```sh
$ cd applicant-frontend
$ npm install
$ npm start
